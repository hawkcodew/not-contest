## To run the frontend locally:
### 1.	Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install 
```

### 2.	Start the development server:

```sh
bun run dev
```

#### The app will be available at http://localhost:5173, which you can use as the Mini App URL in Telegram settings for testing.
### 3.	To build the app for production:

```sh
bun run build
```

#### The production files will be generated in the dist folder â€” this is what you should deploy to your hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or custom domain).
### 4.	To preview the production build locally:

```sh
bun run preview
```

#### This runs a local server serving the built dist folder.
