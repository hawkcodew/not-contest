To run the frontend locally:
1.	Install dependencies:

npm / yarn / bun install 

2.	Start the development server:

npm / yarn / bun run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173, which you can use as the Mini App URL in Telegram settings for testing.
3.	To build the app for production:

npm / yarn / bun run build

The production files will be generated in the dist folder â€” this is what you should deploy to your hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or custom domain).
4.	To preview the production build locally:

npm / yarn / bun run preview

This runs a local server serving the built dist folder.
